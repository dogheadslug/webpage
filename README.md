# webpage

includes something about webpage and web apps

about stupid1.css: I have discovered that it seems that the browser have its own cached version of stupid.css, so changes made to stupid.css will not have any effect(for example, some images are only partially shown due to some settings in original stupid.css). Thus I named the modified version of stupid.css as stupid1.css.
